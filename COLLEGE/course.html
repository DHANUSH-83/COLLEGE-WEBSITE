                <h3>Artifical Intelligence and DataScience</h3>
                <p>Artificial intelligence is the process of creating machines that can think like humans, or at least
                    mimic human behavior in some way. Data science is the application of techniques from statistics,
                    mathematics, computer programming and other fields to solve real-world problems using information
                    technology.</p>

                <h3>Information Technology</h3>
                <p>Information technology is the use of computers to create, process, store, retrieve and exchange all
                    kinds of data and information. IT forms part of information and communications technology.</p>

                <h3>Computer Science And Engineering</h3>
                <p>Computer science and engineering is an academic program at many universities which comprises
                    scientific and engineering aspects of computing. CSE is also a term often used in Europe to
                    translate the name of engineering informatics academic programs.</p>

                <h3>Mechanical Engineering</h3>
                <p>Mechanical engineering is the study of physical machines that may involve force and movement. It is
                    an engineering branch that combines engineering physics and mathematics principles with materials
                    science, to design, analyze, manufacture, and maintain mechanical systems.</p>

                <h3>CIVIL ENGINEERING</h3>
                <p>Civil engineering is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the design, construction,
                    and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, including public works such as
                    roads, bridges, canals, dams, airports, sewage systems, pipelines, structural components of
                    buildings, and railways. </p>

                <h3>Electronics And Communication Engineering</h3>
                <p>Electronic engineering is a sub-discipline of electrical engineering which emerged in the early 20th
                    century and is distinguished by the additional use of active components such as semiconductor
                    devices to amplify and control electric current flow.</p>

                <h3>Science And Humanities</h3>
                <p>Humanities are academic disciplines that study aspects of human society and culture. In the
                    Renaissance, the term contrasted with divinity and referred to what is now called classics, the main
                    area of secular study in universities at the time.</p>
